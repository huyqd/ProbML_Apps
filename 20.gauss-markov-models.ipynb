    "# Probabilistic Machine Learning: Lecture 20 - Gauss-Markov Models\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Lecture 20 of Probabilistic Machine Learning! This lecture introduces **Gauss-Markov Models**, a fundamental class of probabilistic models used for time series analysis. We will explore how conditional independence assumptions lead to computationally efficient inference algorithms like the Kalman Filter and the Rauch-Tung-Striebel Smoother. These algorithms are crucial for processing data that arrives as a stream, enabling real-time predictions and retrospective analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will guide you through the theoretical concepts and provide practical implementations using **JAX** for numerical computations and **Plotly** for interactive visualizations."

    "\n",
    "The overarching goal for this week is to understand **Time Series as a problem class** (Slide 2). We'll break this down into several layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Conceptual Layer**: Conditional Independence affects computational complexity of inference.\n",
    "* **Application Layer**: Data arriving as a stream.\n",
    "* **Model Structure Layer**: Markov Chains / Hidden Markov Models.\n",
    "* **Concrete Model Layer**: Gauss-Markov Models.\n",
    "* **Algorithm Layer**: Kalman Filter & RTS Smoother.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also briefly touch upon generalizations to non-Gaussian models (with approximations) and the theoretical layer of Stochastic Differential Equations."

    "#### 2. Conditional Independence and Computational Complexity of Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "As we've seen throughout this course (and recapped in Lecture 2, Slides 3-4), conditional independence plays a crucial role in determining the computational complexity of inference. For complex probabilistic models, exploiting independence structures can drastically reduce the computational burden.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Parametric Models (Graphical View)**: In parametric models, data points are conditionally independent given the model weights. This leads to inference complexity often scaling as $\\mathcal{O}(NF^2 + F^3)$ for $F$ parameters and $N$ data points (Slide 5).\n",
    "* **Nonparametric Models (Graphical View)**: In contrast, nonparametric models like Gaussian Processes typically have no finite sufficient statistic, meaning all data points directly interact. This results in inference complexity scaling as $\\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ (Slide 6), which becomes prohibitive for large $N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This distinction highlights the challenge when dealing with time series, where $N$ can grow indefinitely."

    "#### 3. Time Series: $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ Inference is Indispensable\n",
    "\n",
    "When data arrives as a stream, we require inference that scales linearly with the number of observations, i.e., $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ (Slide 7). This is the defining characteristic of a **time series** (Slide 8).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**: A time series is a sequence $[y(t_i)]_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ of observations $y_i := x(t_i) \\in \\mathbb{Y}$, indexed by a scalar variable $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. In many applications, the time points $t_j$ are equally spaced: $t_i = t_0 + i \\cdot \\delta_t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of time series are ubiquitous:\n",
    "* Climate & weather observations\n",
    "* Sensor readings in cars\n",
    "* EEG, ECG, patch clamp signals\n",
    "* Stock prices, supply & demand data\n",
    "\n",
    "Inference in time series often needs to happen in real-time and scale to an unbounded set of data, typically on small-scale or embedded systems. This necessitates (low) constant time and memory complexity per time step."

    "#### 4. Markov Chains: Processes with a \"Local Memory\"\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ inference, we need a model with \"local memory\" that is \"passed forward\" through time. This concept is formalized by **Markov Chains**, and associated models are called **State-Space Models** (Slide 9).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**: A joint distribution $p(X)$ over a sequence of random variables $X := [x_0, \\dots, x_N]$ is said to have the **Markov property** if:\n",
    "$$p(x_i | x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_{i-1}) = p(x_i | x_{i-1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The sequence is then called a Markov chain. This means the future state $x_i$ only depends on the immediate past state $x_{i-1}$, not on the entire history. This conditional independence structure is key to efficient inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "In state-space models, we typically assume:\n",
    "* **State transition**: $p(x_t | X_{0:t-1}) = p(x_t | x_{t-1})$ (the Markov property for the latent states).\n",
    "* **Observation likelihood**: $p(y_t | X) = p(y_t | x_t)$ (observations depend only on the current latent state).\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure allows for inference to be separated into three operations (Slides 15-22):\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Predict (Chapman-Kolmogorov Equation)**: Propagating the belief about the state forward in time.\n",
    "    $$p(x_t | Y_{0:t-1}) = \\int p(x_t | x_{t-1}) p(x_{t-1} | Y_{0:t-1}) dx_{t-1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Update (Bayes' Theorem)**: Incorporating a new observation $y_t$ to refine the belief about the current state.\n",
    "    $$p(x_t | Y_{0:t}) = \\frac{p(y_t | x_t) p(x_t | Y_{0:t-1})}{p(y_t)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Smooth (Backward Pass)**: Refining past state estimates by incorporating future observations.\n",
    "    $$p(x_t | Y) = p(x_t | Y_{0:t}) \\int \\frac{p(x_{t+1} | x_t) p(x_{t+1} | Y)}{p(x_{t+1} | Y_{0:t})} dx_{t+1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Both filtering (predict + update) and smoothing can be performed in $\\mathcal{O}(T)$ time, where $T$ is the number of time steps."

    "\n",
    "A **state space model** is a mathematical framework for modeling time series data where we assume there is an underlying (possibly unobserved) process, called the **state**, that evolves over time and generates the observed data. The model is defined by two equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **State Transition (Dynamics):**\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    x_t = A x_{t-1} + w_t, \\quad w_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, Q)\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    - $x_t$: The hidden (latent) state at time $t$.\n",
    "    - $A$: State transition matrix (how the state evolves).\n",
    "    - $w_t$: Process noise (randomness in the evolution), Gaussian with covariance $Q$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Observation (Measurement):**\n",
    "    $$\n",

    "    - $H$: Observation matrix (how the state is mapped to observations).\n",
    "    - $v_t$: Observation noise, Gaussian with covariance $R$.\n",

    "The **Kalman Filter** is an algorithm for **sequentially estimating** the hidden state $x_t$ of a linear Gaussian state space model, given a sequence of noisy observations $y_{1:t}$. It is optimal (in the mean squared error sense) when the model is linear and all noise is Gaussian.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Ideas:\n",
    "- **Recursive:** The filter updates its estimate as each new observation arrives, without needing to store all past data.\n",
    "- **Probabilistic:** It maintains a Gaussian belief (mean and covariance) about the current state.\n",
    "- **Efficient:** Each update is $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ in time and memory per step (for fixed state dimension).\n",

    "1. **Prediction (Time Update):**\n",
    "    - Use the previous state estimate to predict the current state **before** seeing the new observation.\n",
    "    - Equations:\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Update (Measurement Update):**\n",
    "    - Incorporate the new observation $y_t$ to refine the state estimate.\n",

    "### State Space Models: A General Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Kalman Filter** is an inference algorithm for **linear Gaussian state space models** (also called Gauss-Markov models). Here, \"inference algorithm\" means a method for **estimating the hidden (latent) states** of the model, given the observed data. This is different from \"statistical inference\" in the classical sense (such as hypothesis testing or parameter estimation).\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the context of state space models, **inference** refers to the process of computing the probability distribution (or point estimates, such as the mean and covariance) of the hidden state variables at each time step, given all the observations up to that point (filtering), or all observations in the sequence (smoothing).\n",
    "- The Kalman filter provides an efficient, recursive way to perform this state estimation for linear-Gaussian models.\n",
    "- In contrast, **statistical inference** usually refers to learning the model parameters (like $A$, $Q$, $H$, $R$) from data, or testing hypotheses about them.\n",

    "So, in summary:  \n",
    "- **Kalman filter as an inference algorithm**: Computes the best estimate of the hidden states over time, given the model parameters and observed data.\n",
    "- **Statistical inference**: Typically refers to learning or testing about the model parameters themselves.\n",

    "### Interpreting the Results of State Estimation from the Kalman Filter (KF) and RTS Smoother\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run the Kalman Filter (KF) and Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) Smoother on a state space model, you obtain **estimates of the hidden (latent) states** at each time step, not the model parameters themselves. Here’s how to interpret these results:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **State Estimates vs. Parameter Estimates**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **State Estimates** (`filtered_means`, `smoothed_means`):  \n",
    "    These are the best guesses (means) of the hidden state vector at each time step, given the observations and the current model parameters ($A$, $Q$, $H$, $R$, $m_0$, $P_0$).\n",
    "        - **Kalman Filter:** $p(x_t \\mid y_{1:t})$ — uses only past and present data.\n",
    "        - **RTS Smoother:** $p(x_t \\mid y_{1:T})$ — uses all data (past and future).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameter Estimates**:  \n",
    "    The matrices $A$, $Q$, $H$, $R$, $m_0$, $P_0$ are typically **assumed known** when running the filter/smoother. If you want to fit (learn) these parameters from data, you need to use a separate procedure (e.g., Expectation-Maximization, maximum likelihood, or Bayesian inference).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **What Do the State Estimates Tell Us?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Filtered Means (`filtered_means`)**:  \n",
    "    At each time $t$, this is your best estimate of the state, using all data up to $t$. Useful for real-time tracking and forecasting.\n",

    "- **Smoothed Means (`smoothed_means`)**:  \n",
    "    At each time $t$, this is your best estimate of the state, using all data in the sequence. Useful for retrospective analysis, denoising, and signal reconstruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Uncertainties (`filtered_stds`, `smoothed_stds`)**:  \n",
    "    The standard deviations (square roots of the diagonal of the covariance matrices) quantify your uncertainty about each state component at each time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **How to Use These Results**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interpretation**:  \n",
    "    - The estimated states can be interpreted according to your model structure. For example, in a local trend + seasonality model:\n",
    "        - The first state might represent the **level** (baseline).\n",
    "        - The second state might represent the **trend** (slope).\n",
    "        - The remaining states might represent **seasonal effects**.\n",
    "    - By plotting these components, you can see how the underlying process evolves over time, separated from noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Diagnostics**:  \n",
    "    - If the filter/smoother estimates track the true states well (in simulation), your model is likely well-specified.\n",
    "    - Large uncertainties or systematic deviations may indicate model mismatch or the need for parameter tuning.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **KF/RTS do not fit parameters**:  \n",
    "    The Kalman Filter and RTS Smoother **assume** the model parameters are known. They only estimate the hidden states.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameter Learning**:  \n",
    "    To fit parameters ($A$, $Q$, $H$, $R$, etc.) from data, you typically use:\n",
    "        - **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)**: Find parameters that maximize the likelihood of the observed data, often using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.\n",
    "        - **Bayesian Inference**: Place priors on parameters and infer their posterior distributions.\n",
    "    - After fitting, you can rerun the KF/RTS with the learned parameters for improved state estimation.\n",

    "The Kalman Filter is for linear systems. Briefly research the concept of the **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)**, which handles non-linear state transitions and/or observation models by linearizing them around the current mean estimate. Describe conceptually how you would modify the `kalman_filter` function to incorporate a non-linear `f(x_t-1)` or `h(x_t)` function using JAX's `jax.jacobian` for linearization."
