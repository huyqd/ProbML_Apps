    "# Computation and Inference in Gaussian Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the final lecture in our **Probabilistic Machine Learning** series! In previous sessions, we established **Gaussian Processes (GPs)** as powerful probabilistic models for functions, explored various kernel functions, and delved into the theoretical underpinnings of **RKHS** and the connection between Bayesian GPs and Frequentist kernel methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lecture Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we'll bring together the concepts of computation and inference. We'll challenge the common perception of computational complexity in GPs versus deep learning and show how core linear algebra routines are, in essence, learning algorithms themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Specifically, we will:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Revisit** the computational bottleneck of GPs and address common misunderstandings about their $O(N^3)$ complexity.\n",
    "- **Explore** how matrix decompositions, particularly Cholesky, can be viewed as iterative \"data loading\" or \"learning\" processes.\n",
    "- **Introduce** Schur complements and their role in efficiently updating inverse matrices and solutions.\n",
    "- **Demonstrate** how iterative methods like Conjugate Gradients (via the Lanczos process) can provide efficient ways to update GP posteriors, offering a bridge between exact Bayesian inference and scalable iterative optimization.\n",
    "- **Conclude** that for GPs, there is no fundamental separation between \"computing\" and \"learning\"; numerical algorithms are learning machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture will provide a holistic view of the interplay between mathematical theory, numerical methods, and the practical implications for probabilistic machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Training Metaphor: Context of the Course\n",
    "\n",
    "Our overarching goal for this course has been to develop a **probabilistic perspective** on contemporary machine learning. In this view, the process of \"learning\" is re-phrased as **inference**, which involves manipulating probability distributions on hypothesis spaces (e.g., function spaces for GPs).\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have developed the analytic framework of **Gaussian Process (GP) regression** from first principles. This yields a clean and elegant picture, offering exact posterior distributions over functions. However, this analytic framework is practically limited in a few key ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It's primarily limited to real-valued functions $f: X \\to \\mathbb{R}^C$ (though extensions exist for multi-output GPs).\n",
    "- It inherently requires low-level linear algebra operations, particularly matrix inversions or solving linear systems involving the $N \\times N$ kernel matrix, which leads to $O(N^3)$ computational complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the coming lectures (and in the broader context of machine learning research), we trace a path all the way to contemporary deep learning. This involves thinking both about the **model** (what we're trying to learn) and about the **computation** (how we actually perform the learning).\n",
    "\n",
    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "### Addressing a Common Misunderstanding: Computational Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GPs are $O(N^3)$**\n",
    "- **Deep learning is $O(1)$ (per training step, for a fixed batch size)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This comparison is often misleading because it compares a hard upper bound (for exact GP inference) to a loose lower bound (for a single stochastic gradient descent step in deep learning). The true picture is more nuanced, and we'll explore why this distinction is critical.\n",

    "## The Cholesky Decomposition: Recap & Pseudocode\n",

    "## Computing the Inverse Alongside the Decomposition: Cholesky as a Linear Solver\n",

    "# Takeaways: Cholesky Iterations and Uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "The iterative nature of the Cholesky decomposition reveals important insights about its computational properties and its role in Gaussian Process (GP) inference:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 **Key Insights**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Superlinear Expense:**  \n",
    "    - Each iteration $i$ of Cholesky is $\\mathcal{O}((N-i)^2)$, but the total computational complexity is $\\mathcal{O}(N^3)$.\n",
    "    - This means that as the matrix gets wider, each step becomes more expensive, and the overall cost grows rapidly with $N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Comparison to SGD:**  \n",
    "    - Cholesky is computationally more expensive than a single step of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), which is typically $\\mathcal{O}(B)$ (where $B$ is the batch size) and does **not** depend on the total dataset size $N$.\n",
    "    - In contrast, Cholesky's cost is tied directly to the full dataset (or kernel matrix).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Difference: Uncertainty Quantification:**  \n",
    "    - **Cholesky** provides direct access to uncertainty: we obtain the full posterior covariance matrix (or its inverse), which quantifies our uncertainty about predictions.\n",
    "    - **SGD** (in its basic form) only provides a point estimate (the mean), without uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **One \"Epoch\":**  \n",
    "    - Cholesky completes \"training\" (i.e., exact inference) in a single pass (one \"epoch\") over the data or matrix columns.\n",
    "    - SGD typically requires many epochs to converge to a good solution.\n",
